# Active Directory Lab on VirtualBox

## üìñ Project Overview
This project demonstrates setting up an **Active Directory Domain Controller** with **DNS** on Windows Server running inside VirtualBox.  
It is part of my cybersecurity portfolio to showcase skills in **networking, domain management, and Windows administration**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Lab Environment
- **VirtualBox** (VM hypervisor)
- **Windows Server 2019/2022** (Domain Controller)
- **Windows 10 Client** (Domain member)
- **Networking**: NAT + Host-Only Adapter

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps

### 1. Create the Virtual Machines
- Installed Windows Server as the Domain Controller.
- Configured network adapters: **NAT** (for internet) + **Host-Only** (for internal lab network).

### 2. Install Active Directory & DNS
- Added the **AD DS** and **DNS Server** roles in Server Manager.
- Promoted the server to a **Domain Controller** for the domain `lab.local`.

### 3. Configure DNS
- Verified DNS installation.
- Set the Domain Controller to forward external queries to Google DNS (8.8.8.8).

### 4. Create Organizational Units (OUs) and Users
- Created a new OU called `IT`.
- Added test users inside Active Directory.

### 5. Join Windows 10 Client to the Domain
- Installed Windows 10 as a client VM.
- Configured IP/DNS to point to the Domain Controller.
- Successfully joined `lab.local`.

### 6. Apply Group Policy
- Created a **Group Policy Object (GPO)** to enforce settings (like desktop wallpaper).
- Applied GPO to the `IT` OU.

## ‚úÖ Results
- Domain Controller with AD DS & DNS configured.
- Users and OUs created successfully.
- Windows 10 client joined to the domain.
- Group Policy applied and verified.
